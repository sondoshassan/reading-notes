## layout in CSS
we have multiple values for **position rule** like *fixed, relative, sticky and absolute*. we can use **float** to move the content right or left and make the content like  a table. we have fix page which uses pixels and we have a liquid page that uses percentage. we use a grid layout to organize the element on a page. This grid is called the 960-pixel grid and is widely used by web designers. Also, I read about how you can connect the CSS sheet by `@import`.

### the advantege of liquid layout 
1. the page fill the window
2. you don't need scroll to the side

### the disadvantege of liquid layout 
1. maybe the desgin change
2. change the line of text
