## Routing
by using react-router-dom and import it `import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'`. we will use `<Link>` tag instead of `<a>` tag. type of router for browser based projects, there are `<BrowserRouter>` and `<HashRouter>` components.

## Composition
React elements like `<Contacts />` and `<Chat />` are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.
