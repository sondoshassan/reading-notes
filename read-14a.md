## Database Normalization
is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

we use database normalization to:
- minimize duplicate data
- minimize or avoid data modification issues
- simplify queries

form of normalization:
1. The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
2. The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.
3. the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
