## Images Html
Use the image to make your web looking beautiful. we use `<img>` tag for adding images, `<img>` tag has many attribute like *src, alt, title, height, width and align*. Also, I read about some properties of the image. We can also use the `<figure>` tag to add the image.

## Color CSS
the ways to specific color are RGB, Hex and color name. In CSS you can adjust the opacity. HSL is hue, saturation and lightness.

## Text CSS
I read about typeface terminology. To use the font family, you need to install typeface. We can change properties of the font by `font-family`, `font-size`, `@font-face` allows you to use a font even it is not installed in computer of person browsing, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-transform` to makeÂ text uppercase, lowercase and capitalize.
