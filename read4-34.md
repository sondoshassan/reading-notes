## RBAC: ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control.

Through RBAC, you can control what end-users can do at both broad and granular levels. You can designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user, and align roles and access permissions with your employeesâ€™ positions in the organization. Permissions are allocated only with enough access as needed for employees to do their jobs. 

The benefit of RBAC managing and auditing network access is essential to information security, reducing administrative work and IT support, maximizing operational efficiency and Improving compliance.
