# Next.Js vs Gatsby vs CRA
## CRA (create React App)
it generates HTML code needed to render on the client side. So when you look at the source code before rendering, you can see it’s basically few js files and an empty div. These js files inject content into that div in the browser (Client-side rendering).

## Next.js
supports server-side rendering. What it essentially means is that necessary HTML code is generated from the server itself, based on the URL.

## Gatsby
called `Static Site Generator`. If you’re new to static site generators, those are generators which build HTML code during the build, by fetching data from some APIs, markdown files or anything.
