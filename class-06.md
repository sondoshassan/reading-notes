## Problem domain
to learn new technologies you need to study one by one. Also, understanding the problem is the most critical piece of equations. You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

## Object
It is a group of variables and functions. We have two types of object Literal and constructor notation. You can update the value of variable in the object and delete it.


## DOM
You can select the element in tree DOM by id, class, tag name and query selector. Then you can make the change on it by **text content and innerhtml** or using DOM manipulation techniques. Also, you can use sibling, child, and parents to select the element node. DOM is like *jquery*.
