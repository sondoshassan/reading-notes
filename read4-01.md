## Solve Programming Problems
In this article, I read about how are programming thinking and what the technique they use to improve their self in solving a problem.

### The most common mistake happen at interview
the people make many mistakes in the interview but tho most common mistake is they start to write code without understanding the problem and thinking in a difficult way.


### steps for solve problem
before you start coding read the problem twice and make sure you understand the problem. then solve the problem manually with 3 sets then try to optimize the manual steps write comment or pseudo-code (which can translate it to real code) then replace the pseudo code with real code and try to optimize your real code.

if you faced a big problem, divide it then tries to solve sub-problem individual.

***And keep practicing to be more confidence***


## Act like you make $1000/hr
the enemy for you the laziness and business. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. practice your self to say no when you say no the successful people say no for dozen things. give your time value and focus when you work to can achieve many things in a short time.


## How to think like a programmer

if you learn programming you woll learn how to thinking, because the programming help you to think and solve problem in a good way. Every body at the begnning they try a solution if not work try another but this method is not efficient at all. the best way frame work and practicing.

the framework is a great method to solve the problem and it's simple. At first, you need to understand the problem and try to explain it, then plan how to solve this problem by writing the steps to go from input to output. If you have a big problem try to divide it then solve each sub-problem individual. If you stuck just take a breath and keep try.

the practice is a method to make your self good solver you can improve your self by playing video games, chess, puzzles and solve more code challenges.
