## Graphs 
is non-linear data structure it contains vertices or node connected by line segments named edges.
we have Directed and unDirected graph.

## Types of Graphs
- Undirected Graphs
each edge is undirected or bi-directional. for example the node connected wit many nodes.
- Directed Graphs (Digraph)
Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
- Complete Graphs
when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- Connected
is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- Disconnected
is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
- Acyclic Graph
is a directed graph without cycles.
- Cyclic Graphs
is a graph that has cycles.

two methods to represent graphs:
### Adjacency Matrix
is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix. 
### Adjacency List
is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

## Traversals
### Breadth First
it use queue method Enqueue, dequeue, 
### Depth First
it use stack method push, pop.
