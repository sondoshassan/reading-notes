## Silicon Valley’s gender gap 
I read Silicon Valley’s gender gap article, it takes about the gap between women and men in programming field and how the girls didn't continue in this field and go from programming field to academic field.
I read a statement in this article which is I most haet 'a subtle message to girls and women that it’s not a place where they belong.'
I wish if I can change this idea and make this field more for girls and provide them in this field as I saw in my course we have many special girls and I hope for all girls the best to change this thought and make the girl more powerful in this field.
