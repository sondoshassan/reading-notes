## problem domain 
It is a way to specify the problem and understand it. we use this on you call a variable from the inside object.

## Table Html
we can at Html make a table by using `<table>` tag and make the raw by `<tr>`, for each cells using this `<td>`. you can merge cell by using span attributes. we can make a long table by split it to `<thead>`,`<tbody>` and `<tfoot>`.

## object 
Another type of object is construction notation. you can delete and update on the value of a variable object. we can use many objects built in javascript for *string, number date and time*. It is different between object and array but we can use it to create a complex set.
